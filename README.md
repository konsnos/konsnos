### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi,

I'm a professional game developer. I have been making games for 12 years, 9 of which using the Unity game engine, that have been downloaded by millions of players.

My expertise is **gameplay**, and I'm passionate about understanding how various games work, the design and the process of implementation. I also enjoy working on **AR**, **game AI**, and **optimisation**.

Being a great fan of writing clean and robust code I have an expert understanding of design patterns and pair programming and I always enjoy writing and receiving a code review.

I'm enthusiastic about game jams. I have attended the Global Game Jam in Athens every year in which I take the opportunity to meet and help other teams while I try to learn new ways of making games.

I am also an active member and volunteer for various roles in the Game Developers Association of Greece, growing the game industry in Greece and helping people with the bureaucracy of being a freelancer.

Finally, I'm tech-savvy. I don't go anywhere without measuring my heart rate, sleep patterns, and the distance I've travelled. I enjoy talking to computers and might have made a robot or two with Raspberry Pi.
